### Repo installeren
If you do not use Github desktop yet, stop with what you are doing and download it now. I've spent to much time messing around in the terminal. So that is a little hint from me to you. 😄 <br>
If you are at the code-tab on my Github, you see a green button with the text 'code' in it. Click on that button and click on the option 'open with Github Desktop'. This way, it clones my repo on your computer. Now you can adjust my code and write you own. Good luck! 🍀
